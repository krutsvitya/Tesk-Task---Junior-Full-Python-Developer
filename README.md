Hello!
Firstly u should launch main.py to collect data from website. U will have a data.json file.
Secondly u may start local server server.py and then u can try to do requests. Test get requests u can make with request.py file.

I am really waiting for you feedback. This task was pretty interesting for me. Thanks for this opportunity!

With respect and gratitude, Victor.
